# The .point files

The **.point** files contain the configuration of a point.

These files are stored in **config/points** and can be edited manually.

Alternatively, you can use the point editor that is integrated with More Points

You should have an ftp user in ftp_users.json named **admin** (/point/admin).

Log in to this user to be able to edit the points using the point editor.
